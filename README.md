# Stream Assets and Scripts by Netruitus üêæ

I created this repository to share all the scripts and assets I use for my streaming setup. Whether you're a fellow streamer or just curious, feel free to explore and use anything you find here. I gather ideas from my awesome community and turn them into reality, so you'll find a variety of resources that might be just what you need.

## What's Inside?

You'll find a mix of scripts and other assets that I use to make my streams more engaging and fun. I use different tools and platforms, so everything is categorized and described to help you find exactly what you're looking for.

Feel free to tweak this as you see fit!
